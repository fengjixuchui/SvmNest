SvmNest
==========

Introduction
-------------
SvmNest is base on SimpleSvm .

SvmNest is a minimalistic frame hypervisor for Windows on AMD processors.
It aims to provide small and explanational code to virtualize and nest Secure Virtual Machine (SVM amd-v),
the AMD version of Intel VT-x, with Nested Page Tables (NPT) from a windows driver.

This frame only simulate four event : (VMEXIT_CPUID, VMEXIT_MSR, VMEXIT_VMRUN, VMEXIT_VMMCALL).
This project could simulate SimpleSvmHookMsr in my git. you can learn SvmNest by SimpleSvmHookMsr.
if you want more event to carry, you should code just like my "SvHandleMsrAccessNest".
